# KuriOS

KuriOS is a lightweight operating system that allows Discord channels to essentially function as terminal interfaces. As such, all permissions available for bots on Discord servers are included with KuriOS. The idea behind this initiative was to create an easy to access shared terminal for an untilimited amount of users at the same time. The meaning behind KuriOS originates from the server Kurius, the server it was designed for. Although, the original version of KuriOS was written in Python, and it currently lives in a private repository. 

## Instructions

1) Clone the repository
2) Extract all files in a single folder
3) Install [Go](https://go.dev/) from Google
4) Compile the OS with `go build -o dist/kurios`
